# Your job description
job_description = """
We are seeking a highly capable software engineer (developer), machine learning engineer, or data scientist to join our advanced AI team. The ideal candidate will bring a strong background in software development and machine learning, with a proven ability to deliver impactful results.

üí° What We‚Äôre Looking For:
Seniority matters: We value candidates who have held titles such as Senior Software Engineer, Senior Machine Learning Engineer, or Senior Data Scientist, as these often indicate depth of experience and responsibility. CTO-level leadership or technical strategy roles are also highly regarded.

Education: A degree in Computer Science is strongly preferred, but we also welcome applicants from other STEM backgrounds. Graduates from top-ranking universities will be prioritized.

Professional experience: Candidates who have worked at top-tier tech companies are especially encouraged to apply, as this often reflects a strong engineering foundation and the ability to operate at scale.

Achievements over titles: Exceptional accomplishments such as winning Kaggle competitions, building widely-used open-source tools, or publishing impactful ML research will carry significant weight in our evaluation.

Side projects: We value candidates who demonstrate passion for technology through relevant personal projects, hackathon participation, or freelance/consulting experience in relevant areas. 
Note: Quality assurance or software test engineers are not suitable for this role.
